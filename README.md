> <As per rule: [Done - Do you go beyond 'Done' and follow a 'Definition of Done'](https://rules.ssw.com.au/done-do-you-go-beyond-done-and-follow-a-definition-of-done)?>

### Branches
- Branching strategy is based off [Release Flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/devops-at-microsoft/release-flow) 
- **Main** is the main 'dev' branch
- **Release/xx** is the 'production' one (where xx is the Sprint number)
- Always create a new branch for your PBIs 
- Always delete your branch once your PR has been merged

### Builds
- Changes made to http://github.com/SSWConsulting/SSW.Rules.Content (i.e. rule changes) trigger builds that deploy:
  - **main** to the **staging** site: https://sydiisp01.sydney.ssw.com.au/rules/
  - latest **release/xx** to the **production** site: https://www.ssw.com.au/rules
  
- Branching off **main** to **release/xx**, or making changes to **release/xx** will build and deploy to the **production** site: https://www.ssw.com.au/rules


### Rules repository

> Rules repository lives here: https://github.com/SSWConsulting/SSW.Rules.Content

Merging changes to **main** on this repo will trigger:
- a build/release of the **main** branch in Staging (https://sydiis2016q01.sydney.ssw.com.au/rules/).
- a build/release of the **release** branch Production (https://www.ssw.com.au/rules)
