# RSS Feed Implementation - Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented RSS feed functionality for SSW Rules to allow users to subscribe to recent rule updates.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. RSS Feed Plugin Installation
- Installed `gatsby-plugin-feed@5.13.1` (latest compatible version with Gatsby 5.13.7)
- No security vulnerabilities detected in the package

### 2. RSS Feed Configuration
- Added configuration to `gatsby-config.js`
- Feed is generated at build time for optimal performance
- Output location: `/rss.xml`
- Feed includes 50 most recently updated rules

### 3. Data Sources
The RSS feed pulls from two main data sources:
- **history.json**: Contains git commit history with update timestamps and authors
- **Rule Markdown Files**: Contains rule content, titles, and descriptions

### 4. Feed Features
Each RSS feed entry includes:
- Rule title
- Description (from SEO description or excerpt)
- Last update date and time
- Author who made the last update
- Direct link to the rule
- Unique GUID for feed readers

### 5. Automatic Filtering
- Archived rules are automatically excluded from the feed
- Rules are sorted by most recent update first
- Limited to 50 items to keep feed size manageable

### 6. Documentation
Created comprehensive documentation including:
- `_docs/RSS-Feed.md`: Main documentation
- `_docs/rss-feed-example.xml`: Example of RSS feed output
- Usage instructions
- Technical details

### 7. Validation Script
Created `scripts/validate-rss-config.js` to:
- Validate RSS feed configuration
- Check required fields are present
- Verify feed structure
- Can be run with: `node scripts/validate-rss-config.js`

## How Users Can Use It

### Option 1: RSS Readers
Users can subscribe to the feed at `https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/rss.xml` using:
- Feedly
- Inoreader
- RSS Reader apps
- Browser extensions

### Option 2: Email Notifications via Power Automate
Users can set up Power Automate to:
1. Monitor the RSS feed
2. Send email notifications when new updates are detected
3. Customize notification frequency and format

### Option 3: Custom Integrations
Developers can integrate the RSS feed into:
- Internal tools
- Slack/Teams notifications
- Custom dashboards
- Monitoring systems

## Feed URL
- **Production**: https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/rss.xml
- **Staging**: (staging-url)/rss.xml

## Technical Details

### Configuration Location
```javascript
// gatsby-config.js
{
  resolve: 'gatsby-plugin-feed',
  options: {
    feeds: [{
      serialize: ({ query: { site, allHistoryJson, allMarkdownRemark } }) => {
        // Custom serialization logic
      },
      query: `...GraphQL query...`,
      output: '/rss.xml',
      title: 'SSW Rules - Recent Updates',
      description: 'Stay updated with the latest changes to SSW Rules',
      site_url: 'https://www.ssw.com.au/rules',
      feed_url: 'https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/rss.xml',
      language: 'en',
    }]
  }
}
```

### Build Process
1. Gatsby runs the GraphQL query to fetch rule data and history
2. The serialize function processes the data
3. RSS XML is generated and written to `public/rss.xml`
4. Feed is served as a static file

## Quality Checks

### ✅ Linting
All code passes ESLint checks with zero warnings/errors

### ✅ Security
CodeQL analysis found no security vulnerabilities

### ✅ Validation
RSS configuration validation script confirms all required fields are present

## Files Changed
1. `gatsby-config.js` - Added RSS feed configuration
2. `package.json` - Added gatsby-plugin-feed dependency
3. `yarn.lock` - Lock file updated
4. `_docs/RSS-Feed.md` - Documentation
5. `_docs/rss-feed-example.xml` - Example output
6. `scripts/validate-rss-config.js` - Validation script

## Next Steps for Testing
Once the site is deployed:
1. Navigate to `/rss.xml` to verify the feed is generated
2. Validate the RSS feed using https://validator.w3.org/feed/
3. Test subscription in an RSS reader
4. Verify feed updates when rules are changed
5. Create the Done Video on how to subscribe via Power Automate

## Notes
- The RSS feed is generated at build time, not on-demand
- Feed will update whenever the site is rebuilt
- Maximum of 50 items ensures feed size stays manageable
- Archived rules are automatically excluded
- Feed uses standard RSS 2.0 format with Dublin Core extensions

## Maintenance
The RSS feed requires no ongoing maintenance. It will automatically:
- Update when rules are changed and the site is rebuilt
- Exclude archived rules
- Sort by most recent updates
- Include proper metadata

If changes to the feed are needed, edit the configuration in `gatsby-config.js` and run the validation script to ensure the configuration is still valid.
