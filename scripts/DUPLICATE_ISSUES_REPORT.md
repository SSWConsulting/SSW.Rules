## 🔧 Process Improvement Suggestions

### Automation & Prevention
1. **Implement issue templates** that help users search for existing issues before creating new ones
2. **Add labels** like 'duplicate' and 'needs-triage' to help identify and manage potential duplicates  
3. **Create issue workflows** that automatically suggest similar issues based on title keywords
4. **Implement a periodic review process** for issues with similar keywords or labels

### Workflow Improvements
- **Epic Creation**: Consider creating epics for large features (like TinaCMS migration) to group related issues
- **Regular Triage**: Schedule weekly/bi-weekly issue triage sessions to identify and merge duplicates
- **Label Strategy**: Implement consistent labeling to make pattern identification easier
- **Template Updates**: Update issue templates to include a "Related Issues" section
